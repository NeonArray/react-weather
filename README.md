#React-Weather
This is a simple SPA that fetches weather from OpenWeatherMap and displays the temperature in Fahrenheit. I created this app by following along [The Complete React Web App Developer Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/). I highly recommend it.
